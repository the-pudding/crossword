So, I teamed up with The Pudding to explore people in crosswords and whether they represent the people who could be solving them. We looked at tens of thousands of crosswords, going all the way back to 1942, specifically at clues and answers that involve real people."}],"introPuzzleBefore":[{"type":"text","value":"But before we go too deep, let’s get a <strong>feel</strong> for an actual crossword puzzle. Here’s a miniature one, made up of clues and answers from real crosswords, and solvable with either set of clues. The ones on the left contain white people and the ones on the right contain underrepresented minorities."}],"introPuzzleAfter":[{"type":"text","value":"With the exact same answers, we made two very different puzzle experiences. Maybe you found one set of clues easier to solve, or more in line with the people you know about. Maybe you used some of each. Everyone has a different set of cultural touchpoints and therefore a different solving experience, and all of them are important. For too long, we’ve been catering to a narrow subset."},{"type":"text","value":"Crosswords tell us something about what is important or worth knowing. A puzzle that subtly promotes the idea that white men are the default, the people everyone should know about, is a problem for all of us (yes, even the white men). Crosswords present an opportunity for solvers to learn new things and expand their worldviews. A less homogenous puzzle would do that for many solvers. But more importantly, if you’re a solver like me, it’s meaningful to see yourself and your experiences in the puzzle, especially if they are often unseen or underappreciated. When I see black women engineers, or hardworking athletes, or queer couples centered in a puzzle, it makes me feel seen and important. It’s a reminder that I can be the standard, not just the deviant."},{"type":"text","value":"We sampled tens of thousands of clues across decades and publications from <a href=https://www.saul.pw/xd target=_blank>Saul Pwanson’s crossword corpus</a>. Then, we manually labeled each person’s race and gender after researching them. For the purpose of this analysis, we classified people using <a target=_blank href=https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html>US Census’s categories</a>. We believe that the lines between races and genders are social constructs, and their precise delineations are moving targets without unanimous agreement. We recognize that this is an imperfect method (read more about it below), but it does not change our finding: crossword puzzles are dominated by men of European descent, reserving little space for underrepresented minorities and women."}],"introduceDeepDive":[{"type":"text","value":"There’s one publication that actually over-represents historically underrepresented groups - <strong>USA Today</strong>. In 2020, <strong id=blue>72%</strong> of their clues involving people referenced women and <strong id=pink>48%</strong> referenced underrepresented minorities."},{"type":"text","value":"As of December 2019, The USA Today puzzle is edited by Erik Agard, a 26-year old <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-CwNniV_I target=_blank>crossword champ</a> who told me, “bringing some balance on the representation front is something I actively try to do.” A prominent crossword blogger <a href=https://twitter.com/rexparker/status/1269987378925637635 target=_blank>called</a> USA Today’s puzzle “the most interesting, innovative, and provocative daily crossword” out right now. Let’s take a look at how USA Today, and other publications, are taking a puzzle that’s been called too old, too white, too male, and changing it up."}],"deepDivePart1":[{"type":"text","value":"These are the most common crossword answers that are names in the NYT puzzle. Many are short and easy to fit in the grid. These names aren’t going anywhere because of how crosswords are constructed. Short words with frequently used letters will always be easy to fit into the grid. But some publications are choosing to modernize these answers by using the <strong>clues</strong> to change who the answer refers to."},{"type":"text","value":"Let’s look at a popular in-answer name: <strong>AVA</strong>. It is the shortest allowed length and has two highly usable vowels. Since the 1940s it has almost always been clued to refer to Ava Gardner, a movie star whose career spanned from 1941 to 1986. We’re starting to see some publications, especially USA Today and Universal, modernize this name, often cluing it as Ava DuVernay, an award-winning film director (<a href=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-wrinkle-budget-20160803-snap-story.html target=_blank>the first black woman to direct a live-action film earning $100 million</a>)."}],"deepDivePart2":[{"type":"text","value":"These are the people most commonly referenced in crossword clues. Answering the clue relies on knowledge about that person or their work. You likely know many of these dead white people (William Shakespeare, George Washington, Julius Caesar) because they're considered “common knowledge.” Choosing to include people like this is practical and easy because it capitalizes on their widespread recognition. But instead of leaning on and reinforcing this common knowledge, USA Today is subverting it by bringing new people and experiences to the center. Erik credits this to his team of puzzle constructors. With a diverse group of constructors, USA Today publishes clues like:"},{"type":"clues","clues":["Some monogrammed towels = HISANDHIS","Taking testosterone, for short = ONT","Staples Center, for the L.A.
