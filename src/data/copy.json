Every year, my math teachers would organize this incredibly intense, incredibly silly 4-day long puzzling competition called <a target=”_blank” href=”http://puzzlepalooza.mbhs.edu/”>“Puzzlepalooza”</a>. We would spend the week solving intricate brain teasers, competing in teams. I’ve never forgotten the rush of exhilaration and satisfaction when a lightbulb goes off and the answer finally comes together."},{"type":"text","value":"I continue to chase that feeling, but I’ve always avoided crosswords. I always feel like I’m bad at them, like I don’t know enough for them to be fun, like they’re not for me. But I’ve recently been trying my hand at them, especially after learning about a recent push for more inclusivity in the crossword world."},{"type":"text","value":"The New York Times’s crossword has been criticized for being too old, too white, too male. There are <a target=”_blank” href=”https://www.xwordinfo.com/Women”>far more puzzles made by men than women</a> in major crossword publications. Critics have called out a number of <a target=”_blank” href=”https://theoutline.com/post/1651/the-nyt-crossword-is-old-and-kind-of-racist?zd=8&zi=yr3ke5st”>outdated and offensive clues</a> that indicate that the puzzle is geared towards a very particular worldview. Puzzlemakers who try to defy the norm, referencing knowledge outside of this old white guy worldview, have said that they get their clues rejected because editors find them too obscure or don’t think enough people will know about it. [quote from Eric?]"},{"type":"text","value":"So why does this even matter? Crosswords are just supposed to be fun, right? Beyond the fun, crosswords tell us something about what we think is important, what we think is worth knowing (or learning). They’re a barometer on our collective consciousness. If that’s true, then it matters that they be more relevant and inclusive, unless we think old white men are the only people worth knowing about. It’s meaningful to see yourself and your community in the puzzle - your experiences, heroes, inside jokes - especially if they are often unseen or underappreciated."},{"type":"image","source":"twitter.png"},{"type":"text","value":"So, are crosswords becoming more representative of the world around them? <strong>We set out to discover how inclusive different publications’ puzzles are, by the numbers, when it comes to racial and gender representation in their clues and answers.</strong>"},{"type":"text","value":"We looked at crosswords going all the way back to the 1940s and extracted clues that mention people (in the clue or in the answer). Then, we labeled each person, by hand, with a race and gender. A quick disclaimer about our methods here: We believe that both race and gender are socially constructed and have constantly changing definitions. For the purpose of this analysis, we classified people using <a target=”_blank” href=”https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html”>US Census’s categories</a>. We recognize that this is an imperfect method but it does not change our finding: crossword puzzles are dominated by white men, reserving little space for people of color and women."},{"type":"text","value":"Let’s start by looking back at the New York Times puzzle’s entire history, stretching all the way back to 1942."}],"introduceWaffles":[{"type":"text","value":"Things have been getting better, somewhat.
