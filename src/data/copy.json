I teamed up with The Pudding to see if the people in crossword clues and answers represent the people who could be solving them. To measure this, we looked specifically at clues and answers that include the names of real people."}],"introPuzzleBefore":[{"type":"text","value":"But before we go too deep, let’s get a <span id=box-1>feel</span> for an actual crossword puzzle. Here’s a mini, made up of clues and answers from real crosswords we analyzed.

Maybe you found one set of clues easier to solve, or more in line with the people you know about. Maybe you used some of each. Everyone has a different set of cultural touch points, and therefore a different solving experience. For too long, puzzles have catered to a narrow subset."},{"type":"text","value":"<span id=box-2>Crosswords tell us something about what we think is worth knowing.</span> A puzzle that subtly promotes the idea that white men are the standard, the people everyone should know about, is a problem for all of us (yes, even the white men)."},{"type":"text-with-tooltips","value":"A less homogenous puzzle would be an opportunity for many solvers to expand their worldviews. But more importantly, if you’re a solver like me, it’s meaningful to see yourself and your experiences in the puzzle, especially if they are often unseen or underappreciated. When I see <span id=engineers data-tip=a data-for=engineers>black women engineers</span>, or <span id=athletes data-tip=b data-for=athletes>powerful athletes</span>, or <span id=queer data-tip=c data-for=queer>queer couples</span> centered in a puzzle, it makes me feel seen and signifcant.

Then, we manually labeled each person’s race and gender after researching them. For the purpose of this analysis, we classified people using <a href=https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html>US Census’s categories</a>. We believe that the lines between races and genders are social constructs, and their precise delineations are moving targets without unanimous agreement. We recognize that this is an imperfect method, but it does not change our finding: crossword puzzles are dominated by men of European descent, reserving little space for everyone else. <a href=#method>See a more detailed methodology</a>."}],"introduceDeepDive":[{"type":"text","value":"<span id=box-3>USA Today</span> is the one publication that actually over-represents historically underrepresented groups.

These names aren’t going anywhere because of how crosswords are constructed. Short words with frequently used letters (known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswordese>crosswordese</a>) are perfect for filling the nooks and crannies of a puzzle. But some publications are choosing to modernize these answers with new clues, changing who the answer refers to."},{"type":"text","value":"Let’s look at a popular in-answer name; <strong>AVA</strong>. At three letters, it is the shortest allowed length, and has two highly usable vowels. Since the 1940s, it has almost always been clued to refer to Ava Gardner, a movie star whose career spanned from 1941 to 1986. We’re starting to see some publications, especially USA Today and Universal, modernize this name, often cluing it as Ava DuVernay, an award-winning film director (<a href=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-wrinkle-budget-20160803-snap-story.html>the first black woman to direct a live-action film earning $100 million</a>)."}],"deepDivePart2Intro":[{"type":"text","value":"These are the people most commonly referenced in NYT crossword <span id=box-5>clues</span>."}],"deepDivePart2":[{"type":"text","value":"Answering the clue relies on knowledge about that person or their work.

We focused on 5 of the most well-known publications: New York Times, LA Times, Wall Street Journal, Universal, and USA Today. We randomly sampled puzzles from each publication and decade, and then narrowed them down to the clues and answers that referenced people. The answer needed to be the first name, last name, full name, nickname, acronym, or abbreviated name of a real, famous, individual (not a family or group of people), or the clue needed to contain the name of a real, famous, individual. For the New York Times, we sampled at least 670 of these clues per decade per publication, exceeding the requirements for a 95% confidence interval and 5% margin of error. For the 2020 publication sampling, we only looked at the first 6 months of the year, and sampled 630 clues, for the same confidence and margin."},{"type":"method","value":"We manually labeled each person’s race and gender after researching them. For the purpose of this analysis, we classified race and ethnicity using the <a href=https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html>US Census’s categories</a>. We removed any people who we couldn’t classify confidently based on their self-identification, ancestry, appearance, and context. We recognize that classifying people this way (rather than asking how they personally identify) is imperfect, but at this scale, and since many of the people are dead, that was not feasible."},{"type":"method","value":"For the graphics on race, we split people into two groups — non-Hispanic whites and minoritized racial groups (everyone else).
